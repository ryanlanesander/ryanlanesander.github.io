        <h2>Give It Back To God</h2>
        <h3>June 4th, 2024</h3>
        <h4>Feast of St. Elizabeth Hesselblad</h4>
        <p>Herodians and Pharisees, seeing the burgeoning ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, set out to undermine this young leader without violently putting him down (initially!). An early favorite for these folks was to beleaguer Jesus publicly with quandaries; the Pharisees, their authority centered on being stewards of God’s law, were especially fond of this method. Pressing him on the matter of taxation, they posed the question of whether faithful Jews should pay the census tax to Caesar. Our Lord responds:

Mark 12:17

So Jesus said to them,
“Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
and to God what belongs to God.”
They were utterly amazed at him.

This story comes up in Matthew (22:15-22) and Luke (20:20-26) as well, signifying just how impactful a moment this was. Imagine, a crowd of people waiting on Jesus to answer this question—and imagine yourself, standing in his place, fielding this question. Could you have answered with such conviction that it amazes our enemies and completely silences them? I know I couldn’t; not without His Holy Spirit.

The Pharisees, knowing God as the highest, greatest thing, could not argue with what Jesus said. “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s” is not a message to hold Caesar in high regard. No, when we understand who God is, and the idea is firmly established in our hearts that He is the real King, anything we give to others is something given to us by God. The ground we stand on, the metals within it, the steel forming the press which minted coins—indeed, even the stately visage of the man on the coin itself is not man’s in the end. 

The Herodians, knowing the tax as a keeper of peace and established order in the Roman Empire, hear Jesus say “give to Caesar what is Caesar’s” and are strangely satisfied. After all, if they were asked, they might say the exact same thing. Of course, they lack the long view. Jesus’s declaration to give to God what is God’s means all things will be reconciled to Him—including what in this world appears, for a time, to be Caesar’s. We, with the benefit of time and recorded history, know that the gold of that coin has been trampled into the ground, smelted into another form, or left open for resale on an antique shop today. What was Caesar’s was not always his, and is again not his now.

But with a proper orientation, an orientation with God at the absolute center, we can all know the real owner of all things. And so we can relieve ourselves of anxiety over taxation; we can give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, because in the end, whatever coins we may have will always have been given to us by God anyway—be they many or few, in Caesar’s account or the humble Nazarene disciple’s.

Prayer: Jesus, in mercy you came to take away the sins of the world. Heavenly Father, in divine justice you have given us your unending love. Holy Spirit, help me to forever practice gratitude for this deeply unfair trade—my sins for your gracious love. May I give all I have back to you. Amen.</p>

        <h2>How to Fear a God Who Is Love</h2>
        <h3>May 31, 2024</h3>
        <h4>Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h4>
        <p>In the words of Mary, Mother of God, from the gospel according to St. Luke: 

            Luke 1:50-53
            
            He has mercy on those who fear him in every generation.
            He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
            He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly.
            
            Here, we see Mary rejoicing to God in what is often referred to as The Magnificat. Note that Mary says this all in conversation with her sister, Elizabeth, who has just confirmed to her that she too believes Mary carries the Son of God. So while Mary is rejoicing, she praises God’s mercy on those who fear Him. Rejoicing and singing praise for a God who demands fear? My modern mind is confused; how can it be that this is something to rejoice over?
            
            The answer is deceptively simple: To fear God is to place Him rightly above all else, to view Him as greater than anything else we could ever fear. And the best news ever, the Gospel in sum, is that this greatest thing also happens to be nothing but a love so strong and self-emptying that it becomes man, ministers to the lowly, dies on a cross for no good worldly reason, and rises from the dead in service of the very people who killed Him. Therefore, to fear our God is to hold this pure, Christian love in the highest regard, and to fear nothing else as a direct consequence.
            
            What does this look like in everyday life? Think for example, of the most piously Christian person you know. When they see tarot cards, a black magician or other occultist things, how do they react? They are taken aback, almost as if with fear, no? And yet ask yourself—what, if anything are they fearing? Rest assured, if they believe in God, they don’t fear dark magicians. No, it is not even the darkness itself that they fear, but the potential of falling prey to its appeal, for it would be an affront to God, the greatest thing. What seems to be fear of lesser things, is in truth reverence for the greatest thing: our God, who is pure love.
            
            Prayer: Lord God, heavenly King, you are my almighty father, and the father of all creation. Grant that, by your grace, I will hold you in such loving reverence that I fear nothing but being separated from your complete, self-emptying love for all creation. Amen.</p>
