                University of York look at how many kids’ games have loot boxes. Ultimately 
                they find that “Loot boxes appear to be prevalent in video games that are deemed 
                suitable for children, especially on mobile platforms.”

                <p>   
                Children’s Commissioner (UK) interviewed dozens of kids about their thoughts 
                on gaming. They tended to like the social and sense-of-accomplishment 
                aspects of gaming, but of course things like bullying and frustrations from 
                losing were less popular. Also prominently featured in the article: kids feel 
                like they waste money on chance-based gameplay improvements (player packs in 
                FIFA, loot boxes in Fortnite, microtransactions in several games).

                they game, and they go on to recommend regulation of loot boxes as a form of gambling.
