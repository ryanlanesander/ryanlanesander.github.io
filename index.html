            <h2 class="faithBlogTitle">Silent Prayer - The Private Room</h2>
            <h6>August 23rd, 2024</h6>
            <p>
                Today, as I prayed over a my meal, God revealed to me through the voice of my conscience that
                our minds are like private rooms He has given us where we can be alone with him. We
                all have a mind, an inner dialogue that to the outside world is heard as silence--our own, private room.
                And in this private room, we are offered a special intimacy with God that we cannot experience
                anywhere else or with anyone else but him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Think how in even the most intimate physical privtae rooms, even if our listeners are right up next to us, their ear 
                right next to our mouth, they can never hear what we're saying in our minds. But in our private room, not so. Here we have 
                ultimate, total, intimate privacy with him. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                More privacy than a 
                married couple having pillow talk, expressing how grateful they are God has brought them together softly--softly enough to make
                sure no other soul on earth could hear these professions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                More privacy than a new-born baby being cradled in her mother's 
                arms for the first time, hearing her fisrt whispered proclaimations of how deeply, totally and consumingly 
                she loves her new child. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In our private room with God, indeed, we have access to a deeper, closer, and more private intimacy than even the most intimate 
                human-to-human relationships. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Perhaps the most magical part of this revelation is that through our minds, if we make it our private room 
                with God, all of us can be one-on-one with God at once. So my brothers and sisters, will you make use of this
                extraordinary gift? I pray that you will. Let us all invite God into our the private room of our minds; and
                may He unpack his bags, pour himself tea, put up his feet, and stay forever!
            </p>
            <p>   
                Friends ask God to move in with you into your private room. When you do, he will rejoice saying, 
                "How long I have been waiting! Now may you never be alone again." Amen.

            <h2 class="faithBlogTitle">Personal Psalm 2</h2>
            <h6>August 21st, 2024</h6>
            <p>
                God is my shelter. I dwell in him and he keeps the elements from my body, weakened with age and effort.
                The surrender to his protection is my great strategy, taking me where I need to be without ever leaving.
                A tree stands tall at its center, giving me shade, leaving even the sun to work through him to get to
                me. The water to sustain it is not obvious, but hidden underground where it cannot be seen. And yet it
                flows to the roots, and the soils remain rich. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Life in the Lord is glorious; Lord do not let me leave. Never permit that I may be separated from you.
                In moments of weakness I leave you; in lies of self confiddnce I forget you. Hear now my pleading, oh
                Lord, that I may not be now or hereon convinced of my own sufficiency beyond you. When I step outside
                of your shelter, pull me in. Let me be the person choosing to be in you now unceaseingly. When I step
                beyond your walls, call me a liar and pull be back in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will dwell in the shelter of the Lord all my life. He will not let me leave if I will it; may you
                always be my home, my way, my truth and my life. Amen.

            <h6>August 20th, 2024</h6>
            <p>
                I have become a failure. People look at me and see nothing. The pride I have cannot stand on its own,
                its legs broken and heart failing. The enemy mocks me in constnat reminders of his greatness of being
                over mine. Walls stretch up around me until I can no longer see them; the floor beneath me concrete and 
                rough, too solid to break, too rough to use for rest. I stand an look at the walls, their blankness
                as sure as their towering height.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this moment I know I am infintesimally small. I am the space between one and zero, the space between
                to smaller things. Everything I have, I have lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                You come to me and are so near. In every part of me you begin. The warmth is undeniable--it leaves me and
                stays with me, radiating outward. The walls are overcome in ways I cannot imagine, and you have me walk 
                through them. What was intensely alone is firecely combined. Do not leave me Lord, for I now know how much
                I need you.

    <section id="HigherCalling_August19th2024">
        <h2 class="faithBlogTitle">Higher Calling</h2>
        <h6>August 19th, 2024</h6>
        <p>I identify with the man in the reading today:
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                Matthew 19:16-22

                A young man approached Jesus and said,
                “Teacher, what good must I do to gain eternal life?”
                He answered him, “Why do you ask me about the good?
                There is only One who is good.
                If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
                He asked him, “Which ones?”
                And Jesus replied, “You shall not kill;
                you shall not commit adultery;
                you shall not steal;
                you shall not bear false witness;
                honor your father and your mother;
                and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
                The young man said to him,
                “All of these I have observed. What do I still lack?”
                Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go,
                sell what you have and give to the poor,
                and you will have treasure in heaven.
                Then come, follow me.”
                When the young man heard this statement, he went away sad,
                for he had many possessions.
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            I have a home, furniture, paintings, a car. Computers, instruments, money, and so much more.
            And I walk away sad from Jesus all the time over this. Now, it is not mainly becuase I like these
            possessions themselves per se. No, it's more that if I am to be a productive member of modern society,
            if I am to be a good father and husband someday, if I am to be helpful to anyone without being a drain
            on others, making them provide for me what I cannot provide for myself, well then I must have these things.
            A computer to work on, a car to drive, instruments to make music for projects, money to buy anything else
            that might come up as a need.
        <p> 
            But notice how Jesus never asks the man 
            why he has possessions; surely, Jesus knew that he did have reasons. So why not? I have one very
            uncomfortable answer for myself there from the Holy Spirit, speaking softly in my conscience: "Because, Ryan, 
            that doesn't matter." It doesn't matter why that man had his possessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn't matter why I do either. If Jesus my savior comes to me and asks me to give up all I have to 
            come follow him, I must do it. Not becuase Jesus is some cruel, uncaring God who just wants to 
            make people waste their time accumulating things, only for him to ask them to get rid of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No, it's actually quite the opposite. Jesus asks the man to rid of his possessions because
            that is what will be best not only for God's mission, but for the man himself as well. Our God who is love can only
            ever do things out of love for us, for that is all he is: love. And so when he asks us to give up what we have
            and follow him the proper response--as strange as it seems--is "God has told me what to do! What a relief!"
        </p>
            <blockquote2>
            Prayer: God in heaven: You sent down your only son Jesus to be with us and guide us in our lives. In his example,
            you left so many confounding ideas and commands for us worldly creatures, separated from you ever since that day
            in the garden when original sin entered our lives. Help us to overcome that mission with the love of your son on
            the cross, through his death and glorious resurection. May we learn to accept his grace and yours, and live in trust
            with the Holy Spirit to guide us from one moment of saying "yes" to your will to the next, remembering always 
            that you are looking our for us, even when our limited minds and hearts may not be able to see it like you can. 
            Amen.

        <h6>June 4th, 2024</h6>
        <h4>Feast of St. Elizabeth Hesselblad</h4>
        <p>Herodians and Pharisees, seeing the burgeoning ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, 
            set out to undermine this young leader without violently putting him down (initially!). 
            An early favorite for these folks was to beleaguer Jesus publicly with quandaries; 
            the Pharisees, their authority centered on being stewards of God’s law, were especially 
            fond of this method. Pressing him on the matter of taxation, they posed the question of 
            whether faithful Jews should pay the census tax to Caesar. Our Lord responds:
        </p>
            <blockquote>
            So Jesus said to them,
            “Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
            and to God what belongs to God.”
            They were utterly amazed at him.
            ~ Mark 12:17
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            This story comes up in Matthew (22:15-22) and Luke (20:20-26) as well, signifying just 
            how impactful a moment this was. Imagine, a crowd of people waiting on Jesus to answer 
            this question—and imagine yourself, standing in his place, fielding this question. Could 
            you have answered with such conviction that it amazes our enemies and completely silences 
            them? I know I couldn’t; not without His Holy Spirit. The Pharisees, knowing God as the 
            highest, greatest thing, could not argue with what Jesus said. “Give to Caesar what is 
            Caesar’s” is not a message to hold Caesar in high regard. No, when we understand who God 
            is, and the idea is firmly established in our hearts that He is the real King, anything we 
            give to others is something given to us by God. The ground we stand on, the metals within 
            it, the steel forming the press which minted coins—indeed, even the stately visage of the 
            man on the coin itself is not man’s in the end. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Herodians, knowing the tax as a keeper of peace and established order in the Roman 
            Empire, hear Jesus say “give to Caesar what is Caesar’s” and are strangely satisfied. 
            After all, if they were asked, they might say the exact same thing. Of course, they lack 
            the long view. Jesus’s declaration to give to God what is God’s means all things will be 
            reconciled to Him—including what in this world appears, for a time, to be Caesar’s. We, 
            with the benefit of time and recorded history, know that the gold of that coin has been 
            trampled into the ground, smelted into another form, or left open for resale on an antique 
            shop today. What was Caesar’s was not always his, and is again not his now.

            But with a proper orientation, an orientation with God at the absolute center, we can all 
            know the real owner of all things. And so we can relieve ourselves of anxiety over taxation; 
            we can give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, because in the end, whatever coins we may have will 
            always have been given to us by God anyway—be they many or few, in Caesar’s account or the 
            humble Nazarene disciple’s.
        </p>
            <blockquote2>
            Prayer: Jesus, in mercy you came to take away the sins of the world. Heavenly Father, in 
            divine justice you have given us your unending love. Holy Spirit, help me to forever practice 
            gratitude for this deeply unfair trade—my sins for your gracious love. May I give all I have 
            back to you. Amen.

    <section id="HowToFearAGodWhoIsLove_May31st2024">
        <h2 class="faithBlogTitle">How to Fear a God Who Is Love</h2>
        <h6>May 31, 2024</h6>
        <h4>Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h4>
        <p>In the words of Mary, Mother of God, from the gospel according to St. Luke: 
        </p>
            <blockquote>
            Luke 1:50-53
            
            He has mercy on those who fear him in every generation.
            He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
            He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly.
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            Here, we see Mary rejoicing to God in what is often referred to as The Magnificat. Note that 
            Mary says this all in conversation with her sister, Elizabeth, who has just confirmed to her 
            that she too believes Mary carries the Son of God. So while Mary is rejoicing, she praises God’s 
            mercy on those who fear Him. Rejoicing and singing praise for a God who demands fear? My modern 
            mind is confused; how can it be that this is something to rejoice over?
        </p>
        <p> 
            The answer is deceptively simple: To fear God is to place Him rightly above all else, to view 
            Him as greater than anything else we could ever fear. And the best news ever, the Gospel in sum, 
            is that this greatest thing also happens to be nothing but a love so strong and self-emptying 
            that it becomes man, ministers to the lowly, dies on a cross for no good worldly reason, and 
            rises from the dead in service of the very people who killed Him. Therefore, to fear our God is 
            to hold this pure, Christian love in the highest regard, and to fear nothing else as a direct 
            consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does this look like in everyday life? Think for example, of the most piously Christian person 
            you know. When they see tarot cards, a black magician or other occultist things, how do they react? 
            They are taken aback, almost as if with fear, no? And yet ask yourself—what, if anything are they 
            fearing? Rest assured, if they believe in God, they don’t fear dark magicians. No, it is not even 
            the darkness itself that they fear, but the potential of falling prey to its appeal, for it would 
            be an affront to God, the greatest thing. What seems to be fear of lesser things, is in truth reverence 
            for the greatest thing: our God, who is pure love.
        </p>
            <blockquote2>
            Prayer: Lord God, heavenly King, you are my almighty father, and the father of all creation. Grant that, 
            by your grace, I will hold you in such loving reverence that I fear nothing but being separated from 
            your complete, self-emptying love for all creation. Amen.
