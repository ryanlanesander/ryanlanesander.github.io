            <h2>Nickelodeon - Building the Noggin App</h2>
            <h3>Producer from 2021-2024</h3>
            <p>As a creative producer at Noggin, I worked with Nickelodeon characters like Dora,
                Chase, Skye, Marshall (and all the other PAW pups!), and the Bubble Guppies! 
                To make them come alive, I worked in programs like Wrike and Sheets to build 
                timelines & budgets with our project managers and executives, Adobe Creative 
                Cloud & Figma to make sketches, user flows and prototypes, and Unity to build our 
                interactive experiences. My collaborators used programs like Maya, Nuke, Blender and 
                ToonBoom to create the magical Noggin work we made. It was so fun and I loved every
                minute of directing such a talented collection of artists, from designers & animators
                to coders & compositors!

            <p>There I worked under the wonderful Emma Assin, from whom I learned so much about how to
                make great kids games--and simple, effective games overall! For a quick sample of some of
                the experiences we made together, check out the video she put together of some things we
                made over the years. For an in-depth look, check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab!

            <p>The food show in there was even nominated for an emmy award!

            <h2>pocket.watch - Directing & Creating Mixed-Media Series</h2>
            <h3>Producer, Writer & Director from 2019-2021</h3>
            <p>During my time at pocket.watch, I was producing, writing, directing, editing, VFX-making,
                prop-securing and a million other things, too! It was a true joy to spend the second step 
                of career so busy getting so much experience—I feel very fortunate to have been trusted 
                with so much responsibility so early. It paid off, as the show I produced in my time there 
                The Do Crew came in on-time and on-budget, delivering 24 quarter-hour episodes produced from 
                start to finish in under a year! Not bad for a team of 5! 
             </p>

             <p>Just before leaving pocket.watch, I 
                had the pleasure of developing another mixed-media project called Captain Future Pirate for the 
                company, which went on to greenlight after my departure and ultimately sold to Peackock 
                and Amazon Prime for their Ryan and Friends service. Kudos to Derek and the team for bringing it to the 
                finish line!

            <h2>Adult Swim - Network Development Deal</h2>
            <h3>Creator, Writer & Director from 2019-2020</h3>
            <p>I started the sketch comedy group Big Game Home Video with my friends Drew Mullins and Julian 
                Lipoff in 2019 (later joined by Steve Marcario and Ryder Chasin), originally just seeing the 
                channel as a way to make things we thought were unique and funny. Then, after we really hit 
                our stride and had several videos under our belt we decided to pitch Adult Swim through their 
                Development Meeting livestream. It was free, and we liked what we were making, so why not give 
                it a shot right? Leading the team, I called in with a pilot I cut together and some other 
                materials—15 minutes later we were on the path to our first development deal! Of over 1000+ pitches, 
                we were only 1 of 3 to get a development deal from Adult Swim which culminated in 2 pilot scripts 
                that we successfully sold to them. This was such a unique experience! Looking back, I’m convinced 
                that it helped me and my team see ourselves as the professional level creatives that we are today, 
                working for places like Paramount, Netflix, Sesame Street and more.

            <h2>Static Free Media - Marketing, Promotions and Originals</h2>
            <h3>Producer, Writer & Editor from 2017-2019</h3>
            <p>Static Free Media is a small company with big clients. That’s because the creatives who are in 
                this place’s network made the legendary promos that branded Nickelodeon as the place for kids on 
                TV. Led by co-founder Scott Webb, the team at Static Free and I made podcasts, branding decks, animations 
                and other promotional media for clients like Pinna, Wubbanub, Hasbro, pocket.watch & Nickelodeon. 
                During my time there, I got to direct voice actors not just work with them. I got to write scripts 
                and not just review them. I learned what went into making budgets, and then helped to track them. 
                What a rare and special opportunity that was for sparkly, brand-new producer at that time! The trust 
                Scott put in me to handle all of that responsibility was just the thing I needed. As soon at I set 
                foot in the larger companies I’d eventually work for, I knew I was ready for it. Plus, the many, many 
                after-hours conversations about what makes great kids media from <a href="https://fredalan.org/post/842211059/nickelodeons-hero"> the person who branded Nickelodeon</a>.
                Working there was awesome; I will forever cherish those days!
