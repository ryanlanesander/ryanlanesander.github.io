# PIXI Principles

This document outlines key principles to consider when building projects with PIXI.

## 1. Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Rendering:** Minimize the number of draw calls by batching sprites.
- **Resource Management:** Load and unload assets responsibly to maintain smooth performance.
- **Animation Techniques:** Utilize tween libraries (e.g., GSAP) to create smooth animations without overloading the render loop.

## 2. Scene Organization
- **Hierarchy Structure:** Organize elements in layers or containers to manage rendering order efficiently.
- **State Management:** Use state-based approaches to manage different scenes or modes in your application.
- **Cleanup:** Properly dispose of unused objects to free up memory.

## 3. Interactivity & User Experience
- **Event Handling:** Leverage PIXI's interaction manager for handling user input effectively.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the canvas adapts to various screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Feedback:** Provide visual responses to user actions to enhance engagement.

## 4. Code Maintainability
- **Modularization:** Organize code into modules (e.g., helper functions, advanced animations).
- **Documentation:** Keep code well-documented with inline comments and external guides.
- **Version Control:** Manage changes using systems like Git to track progress and collaborate efficiently.

## 5. Integration with Other Libraries
- **Tweening Libraries:** Integrate GSAP for advanced animations.
- **GUI Libraries:** Consider tools like dat.GUI for real-time parameter adjustments.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Ensure compatibility when integrating other tools or APIs.

By following these principles, you can create robust and scalable projects with PIXI, ensuring a seamless experience for end users.
